# Election Analysis 
## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections needed an election analysis performed to certify a U.S. Congressional race. Python and Visual Studio Code were used to write algorithms that confirm and analyze the election results. Our Python script shows the following information:
- Total number of votes casted
- List of counties, how many votes received, and percentage of votes
- List of candidates who received votes, how many votes received, and percentage of votes
- Winner of the election based on popular vote
